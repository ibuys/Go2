				<p><strong>What’s New</strong></p>

<p>Quite a lot. This is the fourth major iteration of Go2, and I've added a few features that I've worked very hard on, and that I hope you love. The user interface has been revamped, adding a left-hand column to make room for my favorite new feature, <em>smart folders</em>.</p>

<p>Smart Folders can help your organize your bookmarks in whatever way makes sense to you. By default, there are five smart folders:</p>

<ol>
<li>Secure Shell</li>
<li>Web Apps</li>
<li>VNC Connections</li>
<li>FTP Servers</li>
</ol>


<p>And the fifth smart folder is the default <em>All Bookmarks</em> folder. You can add new smart folders using your own rules, and there's even a super quick way to add a smart folder from the search field (try searching for a group of bookmarks and pressing “⌘ S”). I've done extensive work on the underlying code, fixing bugs and making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.</p>

<p><strong>Basic Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Go2 is a professional bookmark manager. It is a system administrators tool, a developers right hand, a place to store connection information for bookmarks that you need fast and reliable access to.</p>

<p>At the top of the main Go2 window there are three buttons and a search field. The first button, labeled with a plus sign, is to add a new bookmark. The second button, labeled with a minus sign, is used to remove existing bookmarks. The third field, labeled with a right facing triangle, is used to launch the connection to the highlighted bookmark.</p>

<p>Each of the three buttons also has a corresponding menu option and keyboard command. To add a new bookmark from the keyboard, press the key combination “⌘N”, or to add a new bookmark from the menu, click on “File” and then “New”. To remove a bookmark, highlight the bookmark and press “delete” on the keyboard, or click on “File”, and then “Remove Bookmark” in the menu. To launch the connection to a highlighted bookmark, press “Return” on the keyboard, or click on “File”, and then “Go To Bookmark”.
So far so good, right?
)
If you have a long list of bookmarks, you can use the search field to make it easier to find the one you are looking for. Just click into the search field, or press “⌘F”, and start typing. The search field will look for any part of the name or URL entered for a bookmark, so anything that you can remember will probably work.</p>

<p>The other four buttons are standard buttons for Mac applications. One red button with an “X” to close the window, one orange button with a minus sign to minimize it, and one green button with a plus sign to zoom the window to full screen. If Go2 is already full screen, the zoom button will return it to its normal size. The oval shaped button on the right hand side above the search filed is used to hide or show the toolbar.</p>

<p>You can also hide or show the toolbar by pressing the keyboard combination “option + command + T”, or by pressing “command + F” to both show the toolbar and place the curser into the search field.</p>
