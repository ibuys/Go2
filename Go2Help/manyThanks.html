				<p><em>Personal Thanks</em></p>

<p>I would like to thank you again, for reading this document, and for using Go2. I sincerely hope that Go2 makes your life just a tiny bit easier, and maybe makes getting things done just a little bit faster.</p>

<p>I thank my wife, for her support, for her encouragement, and for her understanding of why I needed to stay up to 2 A.M. writing code. Without her constantly being there for me, neither Farmdog nor Go2 would exist.</p>

<p>I’d like to thank Jim Turner who I met through our local CocoaHeads chapter in Des Moines. Without his expert guidance, freely and generously given for months, Go2 would not be what it is today. Although Jim has moved away to California for bigger and better things, he remains a source of encouragement and enlightenment.</p>

<p>Speaking of the CocoaHeads, I would like to thank them as well. I look forward to our monthly meetings, and I'm convinced that CocoaHeads is a group of the most intelligent, articulate, and interesting people in town.</p>

<p>Thanks to each person who helped with their time and attention during the long beta phase of Go2. Your help is immensely appreciated.</p>

<p>I would also like to thank Daniel Jalkut, developer of MarsEdit and founder of Red Sweater Software. He left an encouraging note on a blog post of mine. If I see you at WWDC, I’ll buy you a beer.</p>

<p><em>Design Thanks</em></p>

<p>The neat little red coffee cup icon was designed by <a href="http://www.seanau.com/">Seanau</a>, who went through several iterations for me at an affordable price.</p>

<p>The new middle information button was designed and kindly donated by <a href="http://www.sause.at/">Thomas Zoechling</a> during the beta testing phase of v1.3. Thanks again!</p>

<p><em>Code Thanks</em></p>

<p>Go2 takes advantage of a few open source code libraries:</p>

<li><a href="http://moapp.tumblr.com/post/732365249/cocoa-preference-window-for-the-lazy-ones">MGPreferencePanel</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Perspx/PXSourceList">PXSourceList</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rogueamoeba.com/sources/">PTHotKey</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/shortcutrecorder/]">ShortcutRecorder Framework</a></li>
</ol>


<p>While I am extremely grateful to the developers behind each of the above projects, my goal for the next version of Go2 is to remove the need for third party libraries.</p>

<p>I have also benefited from the generosity of the Mac developer community, who freely share information, code, and explanations.</p>

<p>The Mac community is a rich and vibrant place, and I feel privileged to be a part of it.</p>
